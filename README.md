# Emperical-Analysis-Wind-Forecasting
With increasing need for renewables energy as the world moves to lower carbon footprint and rapidly evolving smart grid comes a need for developing better energy generation prediction model. As the world moves to renewable sources of energy, introducing them into smart grid , This also raises need to predict their trend, their expected outcome and their consistency as most of renewables are forces of nature which are never constant. Wind is one of the most important source of renewable but it presents challenges. Wind RE is extremely unreliable in terms of consistency and constantly changing. This presents a certain opportunity in terms of prediction as wind also depends on various elements such as temperature , altitude , and location such as closeness to sea. In this paper , we look pervious work done in last decade pertaining to wind prediction for wind based RE and form an empirical analysis based on results obtained , environment factors and contribution , error rate , locality forming as survey of best known implementation of wind prediction and generation system around the globe.
